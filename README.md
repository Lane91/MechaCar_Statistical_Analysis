### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- vehicle weight
- spoiler angle
- All Wheel Drive (AWD)

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

no, because the p-value is less than 0.05 

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The model predicts MPG of MechaCar at an effective rate of 71%, but this model could possibly be refactored to give a more effective rate.
